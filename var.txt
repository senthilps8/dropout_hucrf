E = DxH -> W
labE = KxH -> V
A = KxK -> A
E_bias = 1xH -> b
labE_bias = 1xK -> c
pi = Kx1 -> start factor (pi)
tau = Kx1 -> final factor (tau)


Changes to be made
==================

1. Drop a single specific column from W (E) and V (labE)
2. Drop the same column from b (E_bias)
3.

Suggestions
===========
1. Debugging the normalisation thing
2. tolX change and see
3. One minFunc iteration - same model
4. Model train on all hidden states and drop states in the gradient
5. Likelihood computation over all hidden states and gradient over only the surviving states
